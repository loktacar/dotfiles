This project contains all of my personal configuration files for applications that I use.

Usage:
    - This project is cloned from github and the various config files
      are symlinked to the various contents of the subfolders.
      ex.
            ~/.vimrc -> ~/dotfiles/vim/vimrc
            ~/.vim -> ~/dotfiles/vim/vim

The reasoning behind this setup is for customizability and seamless integration
with git.
