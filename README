This project contains all of my personal configuration files for applications that I use.

My usage:
    - I've pulled this git project into a folder in my home folder called dotfiles.
        ~/ $ mkdir dotfiles/
    - I've removed all the old configurations files
        ~/ $ rm -rf .bashrc .vimrc .vim
    - And instead of the old configuration files I've created symlinks straight into the dotfiles folder.
        ~/ $ ln -s .vimrc ~/
        .
        .
        .

The reasoning behind this setup is for customizability and seamless integration with git.

Vim:
  - I've created two vimrc files:
    .vimrc
      - This file sources the .vim files in the vimrc folder inside
        the .vim folder
    .coding_vimrc
      - This file is indentical to .vimrc except that this file also
        sources vimrc/coding_windows.vim

  - In the .vim/vimrc folder are the files usually contained within .vimrc:
    autocommands.vim 
      - Contains the autocmd commands which tells vim to do certain 
        things at certain times e.g. Turning relative line numbers 
        on when opening a new buffer
    coding_windows.vim 
      - Opens the NERDTree plugin and .viminfo file and sets their size
    mappings.vim 
      - Contains keyboard mappings, see a lower section for more info
    misc.vim 
      - Miscelanious settings
    options.vim
      - Mostly 'set' commands but also some general options that are 
        good to have
    plugin_options.vim
      - Here I set the options for various plugins.

  - Keyboard mappings:
    I've remapped the Enter key to the Escape key
        inoremap <CR> <ESC>`^
    To create a new line while in insert mode you can type 'jj',
    Ctrl+J or just exit insert mode
        inoremap jj <C-J>

    I've also remapped the < and > key's in visual selection mode
        vnoremap < <gv
        vnoremap > >gv
    This is so that upon indenting in visual selection mode the
    visual selection is not lost and I stay in visual selection mode
