This project contains all of my personal configuration files for applications
that I use.

Usage/Installation:
    - This project is cloned from github and the various config files
      are symlinked to the various contents of the subfolders.
      ex.
         VIM
            ~/.vimrc -> ~/dotfiles/vim/vimrc
            ~/.vim -> ~/dotfiles/vim/vim
         GIT
            ~/.gitconfig -> ~/dotfiles/git/gitconfig
            ~/.gitignore -> ~/dotfiles/git/gitignore
         BASH
            ~/.bashrc -> ~/dotfiles/bash/bashrc
         etc.

Within each subdirectory should be a README file describing that particular 
section.

For development purposes it can be better to have a seperate user 
and/or configuration folder that is used for development since editing,
testing, and going live directly can be dangerous.

The reasoning behind this setup is for customizability and seamless
integration with git.
